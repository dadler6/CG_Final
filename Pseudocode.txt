Idea for the algorithm...based on paper.

1. Randomly parition reads into contigs.  alpha contigs initially.
   for each read:

    


2. For each read.  Compute a mapping to see whether we should move the read to a difference sequence
   p(s,o|y*)



3. Once we compute the reads we perform a consensus sequence step.  Update b_so for every spot



4. Chef if a merge p(s|o,y)
